# UFOs

## Overview of Project - Purpose

This project expands on Dana's website by adding additional filters for her UFO sighting table. In addition to the original date filter, users can now filter for city, state, country, and UFO shape as well. This will help users narrow down the desired data easier.

## Results

Results: Describe to Dana how someone might use the new webpage by walking her through the process of using the search criteria. Use images of your webpage during the filtering process to support your explanation.
